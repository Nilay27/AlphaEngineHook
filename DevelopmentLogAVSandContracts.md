### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Complete AVS Deployment and Testing Infrastructure

##### New Contracts Created:
- **`MockPrivacyHook.sol`**: Mock implementation for testing encrypted swap intents
  - Simulates encryption for local testing
  - Integrates with SwapManager to create tasks
  - Provides both `submitEncryptedIntent` and `submitTestIntent` functions

- **Deployment Scripts:**
  - `SwapManagerDeployer.s.sol`: Deploys complete AVS infrastructure
  - `DeployWithMockHook.s.sol`: Deploys mock hook for testing
  - `SwapManagerDeploymentLib.sol`: Library for deployment utilities

##### New Configuration:
- Created `contracts/config/swap-manager/` directory with deployment configs
- Generated deployment artifacts in `deployments/` directory structure

#### 2. CoFHE.js Integration for FHE Operations

##### New Files:
- **`operator/cofheUtils.ts`**: Utilities for FHE encryption/decryption
  - `initializeCofheJs()`: Initialize CoFHE with MOCK environment
  - `decryptAmount()`: Decrypt encrypted swap amounts
  - `encryptAmount()`: Encrypt amounts for testing
  - `decryptSwapTask()`: Helper to decrypt full swap tasks

- **`operator/createEncryptedSwapTasks.ts`**: Traffic generator for testing
  - Creates encrypted swap intents via MockPrivacyHook
  - Monitors for operator responses
  - Simulates real user traffic with various token pairs

#### 3. Operator Registration and Task Processing

##### Key Improvements:
- Fixed operator registration with ECDSAStakeRegistry
- Implemented proper task selection (1 operator minimum, 7 operator committee size)
- Added NewSwapTaskCreated event monitoring
- Implemented task decryption and response flow

##### Current Flow Status:
1. ✅ MockPrivacyHook receives swap intents
2. ✅ SwapManager creates tasks with deterministic operator selection
3. ✅ Operators receive NewSwapTaskCreated events
4. ✅ Operators decrypt amounts (simulated for local testing)
5. ✅ Operators attempt to respond with signatures
6. ⚠️ Signature verification in progress (struct encoding mismatch)

#### 4. Package Updates

##### Dependencies Added:
- `cofhejs`: ^0.2.1-alpha.1 - For FHE operations
- Updated ethers.js and related dependencies
- Added TypeScript support for CoFHE modules

##### Scripts Updated:
```json
{
  "start:operator": "ts-node operator/index.ts",
  "start:traffic": "ts-node operator/createEncryptedSwapTasks.ts",
  "deploy:swap-manager": "...",
  "deploy:mock-hook": "..."
}
```

### Current Working State

#### What's Working:
- Complete deployment pipeline for AVS
- Operator registration with EigenLayer core contracts
- Task creation and operator selection
- Event emission and monitoring
- Simulated encryption/decryption for local testing
- End-to-end flow from intent submission to operator response

#### Known Issues to Fix:
1. **Signature Verification Error (0x8baa579f)**
   - Task struct encoding mismatch between TypeScript and Solidity
   - All fields present but validation failing
   - Need to verify keccak256 encoding matches

2. **CoFHE.js MOCK Environment**
   - Cannot use real FHE encryption on local Anvil
   - Using simulated encryption (direct value encoding)
   - Would need Fhenix testnet or proper mock contracts for real FHE

### Files Modified (Not Committed):
- 38 modified files
- 10 new untracked files
- Key additions: MockPrivacyHook, deployment scripts, CoFHE utilities, traffic generator

### Next Steps:
1. Fix signature verification for operator responses
2. Add proper error handling and recovery
3. Implement slashing conditions for malicious operators
4. Add metrics and monitoring
5. Deploy to testnet with real FHE encryption
6. Implement actual swap execution after consensus

### Critical Fixes for Real FHE Encryption/Decryption

#### 1. Fixed ctHash Extraction from Encrypted Data

**Problem:** The encryption was returning an object with multiple fields (ctHash, securityZone, utype, signature), but the code was trying to encode the entire object instead of just the ctHash.

**Solution:** Extract only the ctHash from the encrypted handle before encoding:
```typescript
// operator/createEncryptedSwapTasks.ts
const encryptedHandle = encResult.data[0];
const ctHash = encryptedHandle.ctHash;  // Extract just the ctHash
return ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().encode(["uint256"], [ctHash]);
```

#### 2. Fixed Bytes Data Decoding in Operator

**Problem:** When decrypting, the operator was reading the offset (0x20) instead of the actual ctHash value from the bytes data.

**Solution:** Skip the first 66 characters (0x + 32 bytes offset) to get the actual ctHash:
```typescript
// operator/cofheUtils.ts
if (encryptedAmount.length > 66) {
    const ctHashHex = '0x' + encryptedAmount.slice(66);
    encryptedHandle = BigInt(ctHashHex);
}
```

#### 3. Implemented CoFHE Mock Contracts Integration

**New Files Added:**
- `contracts/script/DeployCoFHEMocks.s.sol`: Deploys mock FHE contracts
- `scripts/setup-cofhe-anvil.js`: Sets up CoFHE contracts at required addresses
- `operator/cofheConfig.ts`: Configuration for CoFHE.js

**Key Features:**
- Real FHE encryption using CoFHE.js library
- Storage-based decryption from MockCoFHE contract
- TaskManager must be at address `0xeA30c4B8b44078Bbf8a6ef5b9f1eC1626C7848D9` (CoFHE.js requirement)

#### 4. Removed All Hardcoded Addresses

**Problem:** Scripts had fallback hardcoded addresses which could cause issues.

**Solution:** All addresses now read from deployment files, script exits if deployment files not found:
```javascript
// scripts/setup-cofhe-anvil.js
try {
    const deployment = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(deploymentFile, 'utf8'));
    // Use deployment addresses
} catch (e) {
    console.error('ERROR: CoFHE mock contracts deployment file not found!');
    process.exit(1);
}
```

#### 5. Fixed Transaction Nonce Issues

**Problem:** Ethers.js gas estimation was causing "nonce too low" errors.

**Solution:** Add explicit transaction parameters:
```typescript
const nonce = await wallet.getNonce();
const feeData = await provider.getFeeData();
const tx = await mockHook.submitEncryptedIntent(
    intent.tokenIn,
    intent.tokenOut,
    encryptedAmount,
    { nonce: nonce, gasLimit: 500000, gasPrice: feeData.gasPrice }
);
```

#### 6. Added Batch Processing Support

**Implementation:** Batch encryption/decryption for multiple orders without storage conflicts:
```typescript
// Each ctHash gets unique storage slot
const storageSlot = ethers.keccak256(
    ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().encode(
        ["uint256", "uint256"],
        [encryptedHandle, MAPPING_SLOT]
    )
);
```

### Complete Working Flow

The system now supports real FHE encryption/decryption:

1. **Traffic Generator** encrypts amounts using CoFHE.js → extracts ctHash → sends to MockPrivacyHook
2. **SwapManager** creates tasks with encrypted amounts → selects operators
3. **Operators** receive tasks → extract ctHash from bytes → read decrypted value from storage → respond

### Simplified Deployment Process

The deployment is now streamlined to just 3 steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Deploy everything (includes CoFHE setup)
npm run deploy:all

# Step 2: Start operator
npm run start:operator

# Step 3: Generate traffic
npm run start:traffic
```

The `deploy:all` script automatically:
- Deploys EigenLayer core contracts
- Deploys SwapManager AVS
- Deploys MockPrivacyHook
- Deploys CoFHE mock contracts
- Sets up CoFHE contracts at required addresses

### Testing Results

Successfully tested end-to-end flow:
- ✅ Real FHE encryption using CoFHE.js
- ✅ Correct ctHash extraction and encoding
- ✅ Storage-based value retrieval
- ✅ Operator decryption working
- ✅ Task creation and response flow

Example successful decryption:
```
Extracting ctHash from bytes: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020...
Decrypting FHE handle (ctHash): 53734413601763082004684946258124079617387236355262206024543905704868167026176
Found decrypted value at slot 1: 1000000000
```
