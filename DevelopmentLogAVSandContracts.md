# Development Log - AVS and Contracts

## September 10, 2025 (Yesterday - Committed Changes)

### Major Accomplishments from Main Branch to Current Branch (feat/avs-swap-matching)

#### 1. Complete Renaming: HelloWorld → SwapManager
- **Files Renamed:**
  - `HelloWorldServiceManager.sol` → `SwapManager.sol`
  - `IHelloWorldServiceManager.sol` → `ISwapManager.sol`
  - All deployment scripts and libraries updated
  - Test files updated to reflect new naming

#### 2. AVS Integration with Universal Privacy Hook
- **New Contract Interface:** Created `ISwapManager.sol` with encrypted swap task functionality
  ```solidity
  struct SwapTask {
      address hook;
      address user;
      address tokenIn;
      address tokenOut;
      bytes encryptedAmount;
      uint64 deadline;
      uint32 taskCreatedBlock;
      address[] selectedOperators;
  }
  ```

#### 3. Universal Privacy Hook Enhancements
- Added integration with AVS SwapManager for operator-based decryption
- Implemented encrypted token metadata generation tests
- Created `MockSwapManager` for testing privacy hook functionality
- Added comprehensive test suite with 178 new lines of test code

#### 4. Operator Updates
- Modified operator logic to handle swap tasks instead of generic tasks
- Updated Rust crates for operator functionality
- Changed all references from HelloWorld to SwapManager

## September 11, 2025 (Today - Committed)

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Complete AVS Deployment and Testing Infrastructure

##### New Contracts Created:
- **`MockPrivacyHook.sol`**: Mock implementation for testing encrypted swap intents
  - Simulates encryption for local testing
  - Integrates with SwapManager to create tasks
  - Provides both `submitEncryptedIntent` and `submitTestIntent` functions

- **Deployment Scripts:**
  - `SwapManagerDeployer.s.sol`: Deploys complete AVS infrastructure
  - `DeployWithMockHook.s.sol`: Deploys mock hook for testing
  - `SwapManagerDeploymentLib.sol`: Library for deployment utilities

##### New Configuration:
- Created `contracts/config/swap-manager/` directory with deployment configs
- Generated deployment artifacts in `deployments/` directory structure

#### 2. CoFHE.js Integration for FHE Operations

##### New Files:
- **`operator/cofheUtils.ts`**: Utilities for FHE encryption/decryption
  - `initializeCofheJs()`: Initialize CoFHE with MOCK environment
  - `decryptAmount()`: Decrypt encrypted swap amounts
  - `encryptAmount()`: Encrypt amounts for testing
  - `decryptSwapTask()`: Helper to decrypt full swap tasks

- **`operator/createEncryptedSwapTasks.ts`**: Traffic generator for testing
  - Creates encrypted swap intents via MockPrivacyHook
  - Monitors for operator responses
  - Simulates real user traffic with various token pairs

#### 3. Operator Registration and Task Processing

##### Key Improvements:
- Fixed operator registration with ECDSAStakeRegistry
- Implemented proper task selection (1 operator minimum, 7 operator committee size)
- Added NewSwapTaskCreated event monitoring
- Implemented task decryption and response flow

##### Current Flow Status:
1. ✅ MockPrivacyHook receives swap intents
2. ✅ SwapManager creates tasks with deterministic operator selection
3. ✅ Operators receive NewSwapTaskCreated events
4. ✅ Operators decrypt amounts (simulated for local testing)
5. ✅ Operators attempt to respond with signatures
6. ⚠️ Signature verification in progress (struct encoding mismatch)

#### 4. Package Updates

##### Dependencies Added:
- `cofhejs`: ^0.2.1-alpha.1 - For FHE operations
- Updated ethers.js and related dependencies
- Added TypeScript support for CoFHE modules

##### Scripts Updated:
```json
{
  "start:operator": "ts-node operator/index.ts",
  "start:traffic": "ts-node operator/createEncryptedSwapTasks.ts",
  "deploy:swap-manager": "...",
  "deploy:mock-hook": "..."
}
```

### Current Working State

#### What's Working:
- Complete deployment pipeline for AVS
- Operator registration with EigenLayer core contracts
- Task creation and operator selection
- Event emission and monitoring
- Simulated encryption/decryption for local testing
- End-to-end flow from intent submission to operator response

#### Known Issues to Fix:
1. **Signature Verification Error (0x8baa579f)**
   - Task struct encoding mismatch between TypeScript and Solidity
   - All fields present but validation failing
   - Need to verify keccak256 encoding matches

2. **CoFHE.js MOCK Environment**
   - Cannot use real FHE encryption on local Anvil
   - Using simulated encryption (direct value encoding)
   - Would need Fhenix testnet or proper mock contracts for real FHE

### Files Modified (Not Committed):
- 38 modified files
- 10 new untracked files
- Key additions: MockPrivacyHook, deployment scripts, CoFHE utilities, traffic generator

### Next Steps:
1. Fix signature verification for operator responses
2. Add proper error handling and recovery
3. Implement slashing conditions for malicious operators
4. Add metrics and monitoring
5. Deploy to testnet with real FHE encryption
6. Implement actual swap execution after consensus

## Architecture Overview

### Contract Structure:
```
UniversalPrivacyHook (Uniswap V4)
    ↓
MockPrivacyHook (Testing)
    ↓
SwapManager (AVS)
    ↓
Selected Operators (1-7)
    ↓
Decryption & Response
    ↓
Swap Execution
```

### Operator Flow:
1. Register with EigenLayer DelegationManager
2. Register with ECDSAStakeRegistry
3. Register with SwapManager for tasks
4. Monitor NewSwapTaskCreated events
5. Decrypt amounts (when selected)
6. Sign and submit responses
7. Receive rewards for honest behavior

## Testing Instructions

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Anvil
anvil

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts
npm run deploy:core
npm run deploy:swap-manager  
npm run deploy:mock-hook

# Terminal 3: Start operator
npm run start:operator

# Terminal 4: Generate traffic
npm run start:traffic
```

### Expected Output:
- Operator registers successfully
- Traffic generator creates encrypted intents
- Operator receives tasks and attempts to decrypt
- Responses submitted (pending signature fix)
