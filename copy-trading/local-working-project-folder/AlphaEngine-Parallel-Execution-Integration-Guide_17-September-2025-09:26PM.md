Enable 3 development teams to work in parallel on Backend, Frontend, and Smart Contract tracks with minimal blocking dependencies and clear integration milestones.

### 1.2 Key Principles
- **Maximum Parallelization**: Identify truly independent work
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicit handoff points
- **Continuous Integration**: Regular sync points
- **Fail-Fast**: Early detection of integration issues

### 1.3 Success Metrics

## 8. Integration Procedures

### 8.1 Pre-Integration Checklist

```markdown
## Before Creating Integration Branch

### Code Quality
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Code reviewed by peer
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Branch Status
- [ ] Feature complete
- [ ] Rebased on latest main
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Commit history clean

### Dependencies
- [ ] All dependencies documented
- [ ] Breaking changes noted
- [ ] Migration guides written
- [ ] API contracts stable
```

### 8.2 Integration Branch Creation

```bash
# Step 1: Create integration branch
git checkout tdd_preparation
git pull origin tdd_preparation
git checkout -b integration/alpha-subscription
git push -u origin integration/alpha-subscription

# Step 2: Merge Smart Contracts first (foundational)
git merge feature/smart-contracts-fhe
# Resolve any conflicts
# Test: forge test

# Step 3: Merge Backend (depends on contracts)
git merge feature/backend-fhe-subscription
# Resolve conflicts, especially contract addresses
# Test: cd backend && bun test

# Step 4: Merge Frontend (depends on both)
git merge feature/frontend-subscription-ui
# Resolve conflicts in API calls and contract interfaces
# Test: cd frontend && bun test

# Step 5: Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Step 6: If all green, run E2E
npm run test:e2e
```

### 8.3 Conflict Resolution Priority

```yaml
Priority Order:
  1. Smart Contract interfaces (ABI)
  2. Database schemas
  3. API contracts
  4. TypeScript types
  5. UI components
  6. Styles and assets

Resolution Strategy:
  - Always keep contract addresses from smart-contracts branch
  - API routes from backend branch take precedence
  - UI state management from frontend branch
  - When in doubt, discuss in #dev-integration
```

### 8.4 Post-Integration Validation

```bash
# Automated validation script
#!/bin/bash

echo "🔍 Running Post-Integration Validation..."

# Check contracts deployed
if [ -z "$ALPHAENGINE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS" ]; then
  echo "❌ Contract address not set"
  exit 1
fi

# Check backend running
curl -f http://localhost:3001/health || {
  echo "❌ Backend not responding"
  exit 1
}

# Check frontend building
cd frontend && bun run build || {
  echo "❌ Frontend build failed"
  exit 1
}

# Check database
cd ../backend && bun run db:validate || {
  echo "❌ Database validation failed"
  exit 1
}

echo "✅ All validations passed!"
```

## 9. Rollback & Recovery Strategy

### 9.1 Feature Flags Implementation

```typescript
// config/features.ts
export const FEATURES = {
  // Core Features
  FHE_ENCRYPTION: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FHE_ENABLED === 'true',
  NEW_SUBSCRIPTION_FLOW: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NEW_FLOW === 'true',
  SSE_NOTIFICATIONS: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SSE_ENABLED === 'true',

  // Gradual Rollout
  PERCENTAGE_ROLLOUT: parseInt(process.env.ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE || '0'),

  // Emergency Switches
  FALLBACK_MODE: process.env.EMERGENCY_FALLBACK === 'true',
  READ_ONLY_MODE: process.env.READ_ONLY === 'true'
};

// Usage
if (FEATURES.FHE_ENCRYPTION) {
  // New encrypted flow
} else {
  // Fallback to old flow
}
```

### 9.2 Rollback Procedures

#### Level 1: Feature Flag Disable
```bash
# Disable specific feature
export NEXT_PUBLIC_FHE_ENABLED=false
npm run deploy

# Monitor for 30 minutes
# If stable, investigate issue
# If unstable, proceed to Level 2
```

#### Level 2: Branch Rollback
```bash
# Revert integration branch
git checkout integration/alpha-subscription
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force-with-lease

# Redeploy previous version
npm run deploy:previous
```

#### Level 3: Full Rollback
```bash
# Complete rollback to main
git checkout tdd_preparation
git branch -D integration/alpha-subscription
git push origin --delete integration/alpha-subscription

# Deploy stable version
npm run deploy:stable

# Notify all teams
```

### 9.3 Recovery Checklist

```markdown
## Post-Rollback Actions

### Immediate (< 1 hour)
- [ ] System stable
- [ ] Users notified
- [ ] Monitoring enabled
- [ ] Incident report started

### Short-term (< 4 hours)
