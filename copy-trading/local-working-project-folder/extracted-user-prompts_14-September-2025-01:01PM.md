## Prompt 1: Initial Project Context
```
I am planning to port the current frontend from LearnLedger, a Project Management tool where companies could publish projects and students can submit PR to those projects and then get paid once their PR is accepted. Now, I plan to port this frontend and backend to a frontend and backend which implements copy trading. Please check the flow of the thought process in the following images
![copy-trading-flow](local-working-project-folder/copy-trading-flow.png)

The image at local-working-project-folder/copy-trading-flow.png shows the flow of the thought process in the frontend using the wireframes from the perspective of the alpha-generators and alpha-consumers. Also, I have annotated quite a bit about what we are expecting from the frontend. Though I haven't annotated all the screenshots but I would given some insights on how I am thinking to use this for copy trading.

Please check out the screenshots in local-working-project-folder/page-*.png to check the different pages associated with it. I have annotated few of the screenshots to show the flow of the thought process in the frontend using the wireframes from the perspective of the alpha-generators and alpha-consumers. Please help me come up with some idea on how I can update this for copy trading, keeping the image @copy-trading-flow.png

Let me provide you the following clarity about all the relevant pages as well

## Prompt 2: Request for Context Engineering
```
I want you to improve this prompt with the best practices of context engineering. DO NOT EXECUTE THE INSTRUCTIONS, JUST IMPROVE THE PROMPT. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO READ ALL THESE FILES TO GATHER CONTEXT to PROVIDE MUCH better context engineered prompt.

think ultrathink and accordingly give me the context engineered prompt. Do not output anything else
```

## Prompt 3: Projects as Strategies Clarification
```
There are the few clarifications I need to make

"""
- Projects → Trading Strategies: Encrypted DeFi protocol sequences executable in single transactions
"""
Initially I was thinking Projects should be the subscriptions but now I am thinking Projects should be the strategies. Why? Let me explain you my rationale
<rationale>
When I was using Projects as subscription service then there was an added flow of buying a subscription to get access to the set of specific strategists. The alpha-generators could make multiple different variations of the specific subscription and then the alpha-consumers could buy the subscription to get access to the set of specific strategists. Once that is done - I was thinking I will have to define and implement the strategist in the current codebase asa different data model in this codebase
BUT
Now, That I am thinking Projects make much more sense if I am thinking of the strategy as the project since it simplifies a lot of implementations for my project. Let me explain how it simplifies, since we are using projects with stratgies, whoever wants to buy this trading strategy will have to buy the project. This is a simple flow and aligns very much to the current flow - enabling me to do minimum changes in the current codebase i.e. backend and frontend and by taking subscription fees as a percentage of the total revenue generated by the strategy. This would be easy for me to implement on the frontend, backend and in the smart contracts side. We will charge the fees from the smart contract while placing that duplicate trade when users/traders copy their trade.

Similarly, I was thinking of the Pull Requests as a copy trade available for the user to confirm if they buy that strategy (or just add in subscription list) and then it will be executed and I still feel that is the way to go but for reducing the complexity of the current codebase and the associated features, we can make the trades go automated from the user's profile but I guess making it automated trade might be easy only when I am taking user's ERC20 infinite approval.

""
- Rewards/Payments → Revenue Share: Subscription fees and performance-based compensation
""
That simplifies the process as well, we could charge the alpha-consumer to buy or add the project (trade strategies) and then whenever that specific strategy is executed by alpha trader then it would send a trade request to the alpha-consumer and the alpha-consumer would have to confirm the trade request and then the trade would be executed.

Please update the previously provided context engineered prompt based on my above annotations.

think hard and answer in short
```

## Prompt 4: Review Codebase Request
```
Now, I want you to review the whole frontend code and backend code and want you to ensure that you update the above context engineered prompt so that when executing this prompt, it has all the relevant frontend and backend code context.
JUST FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE CONTEXT ENGINEERED PROMPT. DO NOT EXECUTE THE INSTRUCTIONS.
OUTPUT ME ONLY THE CONTEXT ENGINEERED PROMPT.

ULTRATHINK THINK
```

## Prompt 5: MetaMask Clarification
```
Please note that we are not using OCID - instead we would be using Metamask as the web3 wallet
```

## Prompt 6: ChatGPT Instructions Request
```
I am updating the plan by putting my input. Your job is to help me write a instruction for the project AlphaEngine that I created on ChatGPT so that I could leverage ChatGPT 5 Pro's intelligence to properly get the inner insights and structure on how I port this learnledger codebase to copy trading codebase considering all the conversations that i had. Here are some of the thought processes that I have been thinking and accordingly updating the plan on how to improve the plan to completely port this learnledger codebase to copy trading.

think ultrathink and answer in short. Please note that the projects instructions cannot be greater than 8000 characters and so I want you to keep the updated instructions within that character count constraints.

Please use the different sub-pages in this page that I have put in here

while updating the plan for learnledger to copy trading port.

Also, please note that the @local-working-project-folder/MY-NOTES.md contains a similar conversation which contains my raw requests and the Claude Code responses plan improvement process. Please also note that the screenshots are in the folder local-working-project-folder's root folder i.e.
1. local-working-project-folder/page-1-select-page.png
2. local-working-project-folder/page-2-registeration-page.png
and so on.

Also, since I have uploaded the whole code in zip format, the code when it would be analysed would have access to all the files and since the backend contains a lot of unnecessary, partial documented docs specially in the root folder backend . So, please update the instructions keeping these things in mind

Also, please ask me questions where you would need clarifications so that you could write a detailed and good instructions for this project AlphaEngine
```

## Prompt 7: Clarification Answers
```
""
1. Notion Page Access: The Notion link you provided - should the instructions reference specific sub-pages from it? What are the main sub-pages that contain critical information?
""
No, it shouldn't reference from the main sub-pages - it is there for you to write the instructions in a much more detailed by reading it

-----

""
2. Strategy Execution Model:
    - Are strategies executed on-chain or off-chain?
    - Is the confirmation flow: Alpha Generator executes → sends confirmation request to subscribers → subscribers approve → trade executes?
""
Yes, the strategies are executed on-chain

Yes, AlphaGenerators builds strategies or execute the existing strategies and then based on the list, who has subscribed (still deciding between whether to let users freely subscribe to these strategies and then charge as a commission when they place the trades) to these projects

-----

""
3. Fee Structure:
    - Is the fee collected per-trade or as a subscription model?
    - What percentage fee are you planning?
""
I am not sure about it as of now but I am more biased towards collecting it per trade and not as a subscription moel. I will decide the percentages later


--------

""
4. DeFi Protocols Priority:
    - Which protocols should be implemented first (Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Curve)?
    - Are you using mainnet or testnet for initial development?
""
I would be using either anvil for local development or using testnet. Also, I think whatever changes would we need in porting the frontend and backend to copy trading wouldn't need to know this detail i.e. Uniswap, AAVE, Morpho, Pendle

----

""
5. Builder Platform:
    - Is the strategy builder a visual drag-and-drop interface or code-based?
    - How complex should strategies be (simple swaps vs multi-protocol chains)?
""
It is a visual drag and drop interface which get chained together to build complex multi-step strategies

-----

""
 6. Data Migration:
    - Should existing LearnLedger data be preserved or can we start fresh?
    - Any specific tables/data that must be retained?
""
No need to preserve the existing learnledger data - you can start fresh. Actually, you can even permanently delete learnledger artificats

-------

""
7. Smart Contracts:
    - Do you have existing smart contracts deployed?
    - Should instructions include contract deployment steps?
""
No, I don't have the existsing smart contract deployed but we will be integrating it in future, so don't worry about that but if you think you would need some specific functions to be implemented in the smart contracts then please tell me - I will update the code accordingly

----

""
8. Priority Features:
    - What's the MVP scope? (e.g., just strategy subscription without builder)?
    - Which user type should be implemented first (Alpha Generators or Consumers)?
""
In the MVP scope we would need to just show a basic flow of copy trading i.e. copy trader builds their strategies on the AlphaEngine builder platform and then uses it to execute the DeFi strategy. Once he does that then the DeFi strategies is sent to the alpha-consumers who has subscribed to these strategies and then when they confirm these trades then the commission is deducted from their trade.

Also, we will have to build for AlphaGenerators as they are the one who will be building and using the core infra of features that would be used by the alpha-consumers.

ULTRATHINK MODE ON + DEEP CONTEXT MODE ON
```

## Prompt 8: Best Practices Request
```
It seems like it is just instructions, I want you to fetch the best practices on how one should setup a ChatGPT project for development purposes and what they should add in the Project Instructions section of the ChatGPT project.

deep research mode on + update the above instructions using the various context files referneced in the previous prompts.

ultrathink mode on + keep the instructions to be detailed but within 8000 characters
```

## Prompt 9: Subscription Payment Note
```
Please note that to simplify the process, the user would have to pay on-chain to subscribe to those strategies and then the alpha-consumers will start seeing these trades on the dashboard to copy and execute from.

think hard and answer in short
```

## Prompt 10: Remove Commission System
```
Please remove the commission system as if we have to do then we will do it in the contract side. So, don't mention of that anywhere. For now, you should simple understand that the user basically buys a subscripotion for a specific trading strategy and then they will start getting trades which would be executed using that strategy.

ultrathink think and ensure that instructions for chatgpt are as detailed but witin 8000 characters so that I can work on porting the app from learnledger to copy-trading. Please ensure that you don't need to add the timeline as I will decide that after having conversation with the chatgpt and accordingly implement the changes. Also, please note that we have to provide information for context and not for execution. Like - provoding timeline is a execution thing and not context engineering, but if there is an information that needs to be provided then it should be provided as well like - alphaGenerator should be implemented first as it builds up infra for alpha-consumer. So, I want you to update the above instructions for chatGPT

Here is the question that is mentioned in the chatgpt project instructions
""
How can ChatGPT best help you with this project?
You can ask ChatGPT to focus on certain topics, or ask it to use a certain tone or format for responses.
""

ultrathink think and provide me the updated plan only
```

## Prompt 11: Remove Visual Builder
```
please don't mention
""
Visual Builder Component (New)

  Create drag-and-drop interface at frontend/src/components/StrategyBuilder/:
  - Protocol blocks: Swap, Lend, Borrow, Provide Liquidity
  - Parameter inputs per protocol
  - Flow visualization
  - Export as JSON structure
  - Save to strategyJSON field
""
 creation of visual builder as it is a service which gives you the chained component that you execute the trades accordingly

think hard and update the above chatgpt instruction
```

## Prompt 12: TDD Focus Update
```
Everything looks good but in the ""How ChatGPT Should Help"" , I wnat you to mention that ChatGPT should help me in planning a detailed Technical Design Docs which I would use to port the current learnledger to copy-trading

ultrathink mode on + deep context mode on
```

## Prompt 13: Markdown Format Request
```
PLease update this in markdown format so that it can be parsed easily by the chatgpt
```

## Prompt 14: Character Limit Constraint
```
constraint it to 8000 characters as the previous one was within 8000 but this time it is crossed 8000, please make minimal update/deletions so that the content is within 8000 characters. Also, first please tell me what are the changes that you plan to do in order to reduce the length. Please do not change as of now, Just come up with a plan which restrains to 8000 characters

think hard and answer in short
```

## Prompt 15: Don't Integrate Specific Reductions
```
don't integrate
1. 1. Database Tables (~800 chars saved)
    - Convert markdown tables back to compact list format
    - Remove "Type" and "Notes" columns, keep only transformations

2. 4. Environment Variables (~150 chars saved)
    - Merge frontend/backend into single code block
    - Remove section headers
```

## Prompt 16: Keep Tabular Format
```
keep the tabular format and accordingly give me the updated chatGPt instructions for the project
```

## Prompt 17: Final Markdown Format
```
in markdown format pls
```
